\section{Introduction}

\lettrine[lraise=0.05, nindent=0em, slope=-.5em]{\textcolor{Black}{S}}{atellite observations} are crucial for monitoring 
the composition of the Earth's atmosphere on a global scale.
For example, the dramatic ozone depletion in the Antarctic, appearing each local spring, 
could not be properly studied without accurate satellite measurements. Air pollution, greenhouse gases and 
volcanic ash are a few other examples of important 
atmospheric constituents, nowadays routinely observed using space borne sensors...

Will discuss this more in \mbox{Sect.~\refsec{scattering}} and in \mbox{Sect.~\refsec{dumdidum}}, where we bla bla ...
